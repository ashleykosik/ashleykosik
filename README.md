My capstone project for the Bright Paths Program, Whimify, is an app that can track a user's progress in a variety of hobbies. It was hard coded for the categories Movies, Video Games, TV Shows, and Books. In the future I would like to make it possible for user's to create custom categories and change the colors of the UI. Using React I could make the layout collapsable and more mobile friendly. 

While learning java I made the NotesApp from a course and expanded on that concept to make the ResterauntOrdersApp

While learning React I followed a course to make the TodayILearnedFacts app
